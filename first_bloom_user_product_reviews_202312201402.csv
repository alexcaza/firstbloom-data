C’est ici que tout se passe! Honnêtement ce café m’a tout simplement surpris. La cerise noire est en avant plan avec une belle acidité qui se rapproche de l’orange sanguine. Le corps est sirupeux et propose une finale sucrée qui m’a vraiment étonné, venant d’une torréfaction de ce type. Je dois avouer que ce Kenyen est hors-norme mais vraiment agréable.

161,"Wow. Just wow. The aromas coming from this as the bloom was going had me salivating. It smelled like a freshly corked White Zinfandel Rosé. A beautiful medley of grape, pear and fresh berries with the slightest hint of chocolate in the aroma.

As for the flavour, the punches kept rolling. A wonderful combination of strawberry, raspberry and red grape give the thought of chomping on a red starburst. There’s a slight dryness to it that tickles the tongue and a roundness that really gives this coffee a chew. It ends with a sweet milk chocolate + grapefruit finish. Highly recommended!

163,"Kaito did not disappoint with their first Kenyan offering! Holly and Paul do their best to find coffees that’ll delight their customers and it really shows with this sweet, fruity and complex coffee.

In a filter brew the strawberry is very present and is drawn across your mouth. It starts in the front and stays lingering in the back. It has a slight sharpness to it that turns into a brown sugar sweetness as it fades on the back of your palate. A nice blackberry tone sneaks in somewhere during the transition.

As an espresso, this single origin hits hard! Everything gets compressed into a sharp, punchy, fruit bomb that borders on Tomato-y. The strawberry and brown sugar linger even longer when consumed as a straight espresso shot and feel a bit more like a dark chocolate and berry treat.

Well done Kaito, you’ve roasted something special!",4.5,520,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2018-10-18 17:45:56.880,2018-10-18 17:45:56.880

Not over fermented and has a wonderful balance of melon and chocolate when brewed in a Chemex.

It also extracts very nicely as an espresso. Though harder to dial in, it can give a wonderful berry compote flavour / mouthfeel with a lingering chocolate finish. In a flat white the jam cuts through the milk like a razor and offers almost a pie like flavour.

Seth seems to have pushed the development of this coffee just beyond what would be typically done to a coffee of this variety and processing method. I would’ve personally liked to see it a little on the lighter side to accent the acidity a bit more.

I was happy to discover this one in the December Roasters Pack! Still on the chocolate side, but the stone fruit and slight berry notes still came through.

The mouthfeel reminded me of fuzzy peach and blueberry skins and the acidity the predominantly peach. The linger had quite a bit of bakers chocolate.

At first I was admittedly disappointed in the cup—the price of the bag left me with high hopes. After a couple more brews and reflecting on the sheer number of notes dancing around in my palate, I realized my judgement was being swayed heavily by the price point and my own bias.

Looking at this objectively, this coffee is complex, juicy, clean and littered with notes that shift as you sip. When you take into account the price and the labour of love this coffee was, everything comes together to create a high priced coffee that’s worth splitting with friends and geeking out over.

If you’re looking for something to satisfy your craving for a classic profile with a twist, this is a great place to start. If you’re after something with a higher presence of fruit with your dark chocolate (like me!) it might be worth grabbing one of Propeller’s African offerings!

Purchased a bag and brewed it as a pour over. The lime and date really shined with a nice burnt sugar / marshmallow under tone. The finish was still nice and nutty. A solid all around Colombian.

I’ve had better results pulling shots on my espresso machine and found it pops a lot more when made as a straight double shot or in an americano. The acidity and body work well without being too intense to drink without milk. It can work as a milk drink but it definitely gets overshadowed when cut with frothed milk.

Finally I brought it to the Montreal Coffee Academy for a small cupping and there it was, staring me in the face. Complex, sparking and tea-like. All the flavours promised on the bag came through. As the coffee cooled the pink lemonade exploded out after being very berry forward.

666,"One of my favourite South American coffees to date. I love a coffee that harmonizes acidity and richer, earthier notes. I think Kaito nailed it with this one. It packs such a nice punch of red berry and bergamot at the front and smoothly transitions to a bitter sweet chocolate finish with a hint of brown sugar.

I’ve been really, really enjoying this as a double shot of espresso. Doing 17.5g in and 42g out @ ~30s on my Breville Barista Express. The complexity really shines I find.

In a V60 over you get a really buttery mouth feel and the acidity blends very cleanly with the chocolate notes, almost perfectly. There’s a bit of a buttered popcorn vibe to it as it cools, which I quite enjoyed. It’s still vibrant but if you’re looking for something a bit more in your face, highly recommended as an espresso shot.",4.5,1843,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2019-08-05 13:24:11.259,2019-08-05 13:24:11.259

I’m kind of surprised at how toned town the acidity is considering it’s a carbonic process. Well balanced and fairly intricate. 🙌

Recipe

Method: Aeropress (not inverted)
Ratio: 1:10 (20g : 200ml) diluted to 1:18
Temp: 98c
Grind: 10 on my encore
Routine:
- Fill cup with difference of water (160ml)
- Place Aeropress on top of receptacle and fill with grounds
- Pour 200ml and stir constantly until 45s passed
- Place plunger into Aeropress and pull back to create minor suction
- at 1:15 start plunging until you hear the first hiss (should be finished around 2:00)

1246,"For me this coffee really scratched all the itches for a fruity Ethiopian, but it also stood out with an identifiable profile. I found the spice notes to be very present, but in no way overpowered the fruit and I found that to be great. Like a good IPA or Chardonnay, this coffee has all the things you want and expect but packaged into a new experience of pleasantness.

I was juggling a number of coffees and the second half of the bag ended up aging past five weeks. The coffee dropped off pretty sharply from there, so I would recommend either drinking it in the first month or freezing.

1249,"I’ll be honest, if you’re looking for a familiar profile this is not your coffee. It’s not fruity and sugary sweet, and it’s not rich with hazelnut and chocolate. It bucks all of those trends in a beautiful way. The savory notes were woodsy and cathartic, and the mint flavors for me were like spearmint. The sweetness was like eating raw sugar cane, it just coats your mouth. I have pined for this coffee (pun intended) since I finished the bag, and it is certainly my most memorable of 2020. I went for a shorter ratio than normal as these flavors can handle all the body you can give them.
