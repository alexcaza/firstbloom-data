Othaya is a very progressive operation, complete with their own dry mill and quality control lab. They are a large co-op with 19 factories (although not all of them operated in the 2016 season, given the smaller crop), but despite their size, they are producing impeccable quality."

Typically, for small roasters to purchase coffee from Ethiopia, we’re constrained to buying from large scale importers who purchase whole containers through the Oromia Union. As such, it can be very difficult for us to trace back exactly which Farmer’s Coopertive Union (FCU) produced the coffee, being left to operate with only the washing station name.

Thanks to the incredible work of Shared Source, they were able to work directly with the Sor Geba FCU which represents another 147 co-ops, and narrow down their purchase to two lots from the Dika Gabe washing station. This means that we have the ability to next year not only return to the washing station but to the specific lots from each co- op to potentially purchase from the exact same lot once again. This is almost a complete impossibility for small scale roasters, and represents a new frontier in Ethiopian coffee production that we at De Mello are super excited to share in.

Coffee proccessed at Dika Gabe are grown in accordance with traditional, and now legally mandated, organic cultivation methods in which other crops like false banana are interplanted with coffee trees in order to maintain healthy soil. Additionally, the Dika Gabe Co-op is a Technoserve supported Co-op, an initiative that aims to increase the profitability and sustainability of Ethiopia agricultural commodities like coffee.

This means they benefit from training and information sessions on improving coffee quality through processing and also receive an eco-pulper for demuciligation of coffees that uses significantly less water, a serious bonus in a country facing consistent drought conditions.

On top of all of this, the coffee is incredible in quality, one of our favourite ever washed Ethiopians. Its incredibly sweet and smooth, with a thick peach jam mouth feel and red fruit notes that linger beautifully well after the cup is finished!"

Through the past few years, we were still showing our unwavering support as partners, still buying the small amounts that Ramon was able to produce. This is an important part of the story, because if he wasn’t able to sell his small yields at specialty prices a couple years back, it’s possible we wouldn’t see this full and wonderful return to normalcy - which in Ramon’s case is producing the vibrant, articulate, and sweet coffee you have in your cup today.

We are thrilled to offer La Bendicion as our signature Holiday Espresso for the season. The creamy texture, coupled with a sweetness that reminds us of pineapple cake is perfect for warming up fireside."

Ricardo and his team have developed the expertise and understand the nuances of processing the coffee seed in order to achieve its highest levels of quality.


To us at Transcend, Santa Lucia is a gem of a coffee. Not only because the coffee is exceptionally delicious year after year, or because the area surrounding the farm is stunning, but because the people behind it are some of the most genuinely passionate and progressive we’ve met in coffee. Ricardo Perez Barrantes started growing coffee here in 1986 with a commitment to environmentally sustainable production. He was among the first in the West Valley to start his own micro-mill, and see the potential to include coffee growers from his surrounding community.

Being the progressive growers that they are, Ricardo’s daughter Mariana visited Canada to learn about coffee roasting and espresso making with a desire to better understand how Santa Lucia is perceived by Canadian consumers. This means that between growing and roasting this coffee has gotten better every year we’ve bought from them."

This particular coffee we were drawn to trying due to its innovative processing. We're always looking for new processing forms to see what they can do to change the flavour of a coffee. We spoke with Erwin, Doc's son, who runs the day to day operations about how exactly this process work, and he gave us a few notes. 

“The coffee cherry is brought down from the farm (intact), where we have selected the ripest cherries, to the dry mill. Once at the dry mill we keep the cherries in the sack, and we sprinkle it with some water. We then allow a certain amount of controlled fermentation of the cherry. We are always keen to be monitoring the cherries during this time.

This could take around 24 to 36 hours, and the cherries are monitored constantly. Once you can see, and smell, that the cherries have reached the point of the most intense fruitiness. We then lay the cherries out on the patio, and we allow it to sun dry until it has an optimal humidity of 12%.

All lots are then placed in a well ventilated, and fresh, warehouse so that the beans can rest for a period of around 30 days, before it is finally shipped off.”

Doc Mierisch, returned to Nicarauga after a career as a doctor in America with the intention of revitalizing the farm and pushing forward coffee quality. In the resulting years, Mierisch farms has grown to be known world-wide as one of the best producers of Nicaraguan coffee. Along with experimental processing, they’ve also grown an incredible range of varieties from Pacamara to Javanica to the more common varietals, like this one, Bourbon."

They operate two farms, and process all of the coffee through a micro-mill they’ve named Don Eli after Carlos’s late father, Don Eli Montero.

Now in its third generation of coffee farmers, the Montero family branched out into producing specialty grade coffee in the 2014/2015 harvest, a risky move that has already paid great dividends. Carlos’s goal was to achieve a better regulation of his coffee but also to experiment with more innovative processing methods. In so doing, they left behind the mass production concept they’d followed in the past, trading it in for a “quality over quantity” mindset. He’s also been working to institute sustainable practices in his farms, including a focus on organic certification for his whole farm while running a single nano lot that has been chemical-free for years.

While Carlos oversees soil quality and cherry selection, his son Jacob oversees the wet-milling and depupling processes, key components in the production of quality honey processed coffees. His two daughters, Mariajose and Marianela are also closely involved with the farm. Mariajose is only 17 but tends to the African drying beds, monitoring moisture levels and raking the beans hourly. Marianela, handles the logistics and shipping and is currently working to assist other farmers in their regions to access the specialty coffee market.

Red Honey Process: Anibal Red Honey is created by depulping and washing the cherries, while leaving about seventy percent of the mucilage behind. The beans are then left in a thin layer on raised beds to dry for between 15 and 20 days."

The gentle stone fruit acidity is complementary towards the rich syrupy mouthfeel. As it cools, the peanut brittle becomes more like peanut punch, the sugarcane sweetness intensifies, reminding me of freshly pressed sugarcane juice, and the cherry undertone comes alive, reminding me of maraschino cherry.
