## What is this?
This is a collection of coffee data built while Firstbloom was operational. It contains CSVs of the interesting/important data around which coffees a roaster had, the varieties the coffee contained, the tasting notes of those coffees and where they were sourced from in the world.

Since the app shut-down officially in January 2021, I've been sitting on these data. Over the years, I've had people ask me about it, and whether or not they could access it. Mostly for personal projects. I figured I've had enough people ask me that I might as well open-source it under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) instead of spitting out new CSVs when someone asks.

## What was Firstbloom?
Firstbloom started late 2017 as a way for specialty coffee lovers to leave reviews on coffees they were drinking. It was my attempt at a [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/)/[Untappd](https://untappd.com/) but for coffee geeks.

After it launched early 2018, and up until it shutdown in Jan 2021, it gained a few thousand users, but ultimately wasn't growing quite as I had hoped. There were attempted by my co-founder and I to pivot and turn this into a different kind of business, but it ended up burning me out pretty badly, which led to me shutting down the app.

All wasn't lost, however, as these data has already been used in a book (The Physics of Filter Coffee by [Jonathan GagnÃ©](https://coffeeadastra.com/)), and is--to my knowledge--still the largest consumer specialty coffee data set out there. Hopefully it can continue to be used to inspire new projects!
